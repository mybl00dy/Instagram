Instagram-Phisher is a worm designed to spread across instagram and gain the credentials of as many users as possible. This tool has two parts:
### Web Server
The web server is a standard Instagram cradential phising webpage which logs all of the inputted craadentials. Once a user's cradentials are gained, the cradentials will be sent over to the spreading mechanism
### Spreader
Once a user is compermised, this tool will DM a configurable message to all followers and people the user is following a configurable message in an attempt to get other people to click on a link and login to the fake instagram login page.
